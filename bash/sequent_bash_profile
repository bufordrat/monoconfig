# there is no way to make a fish login shell work with Tramp, so I am
# instead using this hack

# since fish doesn't provide an option to turn off the hidden
# ansi-escaped path when it launches, I am using bash as my login
# shell to make Tramp happy

# when TERM isn't dumb, it'll just exec fish in login mode so that I
# can pretend fish is my login shell

[ ! "$TERM" = "dumb" ] && exec fish -l
