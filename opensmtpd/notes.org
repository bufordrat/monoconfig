* setup
** .maildir
+ the config here expects my local mail to be in maildir format,
  located at =~/.maildir/local_mail=
+ it will create the =cur=, =new=, and =tmp= folders there if they
  don't exist, but I think it wants this path to exist
+ on =kleisli=, I symlink it, e.g.:
  #+begin_example
    cd ~ && ln -s Stuff/Email/.maildir
  #+end_example
+ rinse and repeat for what that path would be on other hosts
* crontinuous integration
+ for instructions on setting up crontinuous integration, please see
