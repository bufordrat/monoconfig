* Summary

=monoconfig= is a makefile that allows Matt to keep the configuration
for every configurable app he uses on every machine he uses in one
place.  It also provides a simple one-command install that can be run
on any of the machines that Matt is currently using, which will
install all and only the configuration files that are relevant to that
machine.  It determines which configuration files to install by
checking the hostname of the machine it is running on.

This makefile is not packaged for use by anyone else on any other
machines.  Nonetheless, please feel free to browse the many files in
this repository and copy any config out of them that may be useful to
you.
