* gotchas with =opensmtpd=
** it seems to want the permissions on =/var/spool/mail= to be 1775
+ otherwise, you get this error:
  #+begin_example
    Dec 02 13:15:40 kleisli lockspool[7666]: /var/mail: will not deliver to world-writable spool
    Dec 02 13:15:40 kleisli mail.local[7664]: lockspool: unable to get lock
  #+end_example
+ it's possible that it just wants the sticky bit to be set, in which
  case 1777 is also ok?  matter for further investigation
