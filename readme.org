* Summary

=monoconfig= is a makefile that allows Matt to keep the configuration
for every configurable app he uses on every machine he uses in one
place.  It also provides a simple one-command install that can be run
on any of the machines that Matt is currently using, which will
install all and only the configuration files that are relevant to that
machine.  It determines which configuration files to install by
checking the hostname of the machine it is running on.

This makefile is idiosyncratic to Matt and is not intended for use by
anyone else on any other machines.  Nonetheless, if you are in the
middle of banging on your own configuration, please feel free to
browse the many files in this repository and copy anything out of them
that may be useful to you.
